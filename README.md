# Amazon Tax Prediction (Machine Learning)

( This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict tax amounts from Amazon order data. Using Python and scikit-learn, I performed data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation for a regression problem, with Tax as the target variable. A Random Forest Regressor was trained and evaluated using the R² score, achieving strong predictive performance. The project emphasizes machine learning workflow and model evaluation rather than deep exploratory data analysis and is part of my self-learning journey in data science and machine learning.)


# Problem Type
- Regression  
- Target: Tax  

# Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn

# Model
- RandomForestRegressor
- Evaluation: R² ≈ 0.97

# What This Project Focuses On
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
