Machine learning project to predict tax amounts from Amazon order data using Python and Random Forest regression.

# Amazon Tax Prediction

This project predicts the **Tax amount** for Amazon orders using a **machine learning regression model**.

I used Python and scikit-learn to build an end-to-end ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- Problem type: Regression  
- Target column: Tax  
- Model used: RandomForestRegressor  
- Evaluation metric: R² Score (~0.97)

The project includes feature importance analysis and sample predictions to understand model behavior.

This repository is part of my learning journey in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**.
